		<p><h1>We are very sad to announce....</h1></p>
<p>... that after a lot of thought we will be closing the pub from Sunday, the 4th of December. This was not a decision that was taken lightly and with the current climate as it is we hope you understand the position we are in. We are currently working to contact all Christmas bookings made with us. </p>

	<p>Thank you to everyone who supported us.</p>
